## My name is Layla- I'm in college studying jounalism both by miracle and a lot of hard work. I'm a cat person (I think this is very indicative to the kind of person I am). I love making and seeing art as well as creating content. Something I think about doing in the future is being on the business side of the arts, in any capacity. I'm enjoying being the multimedia editor and look forward to expanding The Brown and White's digital content.

In just one year there's almost a 20% in selectivity- however some of that is reflected not just in the acceptance but in the number of applicants. Part of this may be due to the abnormalities of the COVID-19 delay in college readyiness as well as Lehigh's desire to expand. However the incoming classes have roughly the same size.
