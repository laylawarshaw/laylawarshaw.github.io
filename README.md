## My name is Layla- I'm in college studying jounalism both by miracle and a lot of hard work. I'm a cat person (I think this is very indicative to the kind of person I am). I love making and seeing art as well as creating content. Something I think about doing in the future is being on the business side of the arts, in any capacity. I'm enjoying being the multimedia editor and look forward to expanding The Brown and White's digital content.

In just one year there's almost a 20% in selectivity- however some of that is reflected not just in the acceptance but in the number of applicants. Part of this may be due to the abnormalities of the COVID-19 delay in college readyiness as well as Lehigh's desire to expand. However the incoming classes have roughly the same size.

# The United States of America is falling apart because lesbian bars keep closing! 
## In a world where straight women get off on going out with their girl friends to drag shows, we live in a society where there is only a slightly more than a dozen lesbian bars. That number to be exact is a mere 21. A generous number considering that in the time the number of operations was recorded, several have closed their doors for good. One might imagine that major cities in America, ones flourishing stident and proud lgbt sectors may have at least a dozen lesbian bars alone. But alas, a mere 21 across almost one-third of an entire contient. Representing over 300 million people. While the resturant industry has struggled in and of itself, it's no where near the rate that gay oriented spaces, particular lesbian ones, are diminishing.

## During the 2022 Beijing Olympics, an elite trio of remarkably young Russian figure skaters came under fire after 15-year-old teammate Kamila Valieva tested positive for perfmance enhancing drug. Valieva was allowed to compete but ended up blundering, pasing the win to her 17-year-old rival. This raised burried concerns not only to the notoriously dangerous practices of their coach, but towards the favoring of younger and younger girls in the sport. Russian skating stars only stay in circulation for about a year or two before burning out, resulting in the average age of contestants becoming younger. These younger girls are phyiscally able to perfom things previous (older) Olympic winners would not be able to- notably the "quad." This brief chart shows the actual ages of the last six Olympic gold winners.

# Week 9 Day 222
## Up untill Fall 2020, Lehigh University's admission rate ranged below 30%. In the years leading up to 2020's upward tick in acceptances, enrollment numbers in each college have showed subtle but important changes. In four years (between the fall of 2016 and 2020), enrollment in the College of Arts and Science increased by almost 400 students, while the School of Engineering saw a decrease of nearly 200 students in that same time. Enrollment in the College of Business remains consistent through that time, averaging aroung 1,260 students.

## WEEK 9 DAY 2 HW 
# Over the last ten years, ABC has recorded an austounding drop in viewership of the Academy Awards, a ceremony that is over 90 years old to celebrate the best of film in a year. The most viewed show was in 1998 when an impressive 57 million people tuned in live. Titanic won for Best Picture, amoung other blockbusters like Lord of the Rings and Men in Black. In the years that follow, there was a slow wane in popular, up untill the mid-2010's when 30 to 40 million tuned in. The last three years have marked record lows of more than 50% less, with only about 10 million people tuning in last year. The decline of celebrity infatuation, the box office, cable TV, and the quality of theshow itself have made the future uncertain and worrisome.
